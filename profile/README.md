# About Pelicargo

Airlines and freight forwarders depend on each other to grow and profit, but struggle to consistently match cargo and capacity in time for takeoff. Both parties leave meaningful money and opportunity on the table.
Pelicargo was created to solve this problem at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2021 by Jon Acquaviva, Shinji Angata, and Edward Wang. Since its launch, Pelicargo has seen a rapid demand for its innovative approach.
